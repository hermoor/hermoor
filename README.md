# Hermoor
_By Phani Vemuri, Manfred Ong, Mayank Panjiyara and Prannaya Gupta_

This is a product designed to build an efficient network of Mentally Ill Patients and Trained Psychologists and Caregivers that can easily form connections, with in-built sentiment analysis providing suggestions for easing their mental state.

## What it does
A mobile app that connects one caregiver to another and support each other. A bot that listens to the conversations, perform sentiment analysis and make recommendations based on the sentiment. 

## How we built it
Built using Kotlin, Firebase and cloud functions on GCP platform. Natural language processing for sentiment analysis is performed using Google cloud APIs.

## Challenges we ran into
Integration between firebase and the app. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning and working as a team even though we met online just for this event. 

## What we learned
Stigma and empathy are serious subjects and requires collaboration with a specialist in the caregiving and psychology space. 

## What's next for Hermoor
Partner with caregivers to test the app and to continue to build on it.
